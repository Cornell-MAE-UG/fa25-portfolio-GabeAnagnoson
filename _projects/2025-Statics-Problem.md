For a class, we were asked to design a mechanism to lift a load of maximum weight, the maximum height: We were given aS2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length, 3 pin supports, two of which needed to be mounted on the ground and a linear
actuator of our choice from a catalogm, using its maximum force values and assuming all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.

My solution was to use the bar to rotate the possible load at the maximum possible length with the actuator which had the highest load and largest stroke length.

I used the dimensions and load specifications from the actuator catalog, to find the length of the actuator, and in turn the length of the bar. Then with the length of the extended actuator I used trig identities to find the angle of the actuator with the ground at this extended length. With the max force value now, I found the vertical component of this force, in turn allowing me to find the maximum possible load my design could lift: 35.2kN a height of 43.94cm.x
